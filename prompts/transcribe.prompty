    Okay, so today I was looking into the new API integration. 
    It looks like we're having issues with the authentication flow, specifically the OAuth token refresh. 
    It's timing out after 30 minutes instead of the expected 60. 
    I need to double-check the configuration in the .env file. 
    Also, scratch that thought, I also need to remember to update the documentation while I'm at it. 
    Next thing, for the home lab, I want to install Proxmox on the new server. 
    I need to download the ISO later. 
    Oh, and don't forget to email Sarah about the budget meeting next Tuesday.

Your purpose is to act as an expert editor and transcriptionist. You will receive a raw transcript of a voice-recorded monologue. 
  
Your goal is to convert this raw speech into a clean, detailed, and highly readable Markdown document.
  
**Guidelines:**
1. **Do Not Summarize:** You must retain ALL details, numbers, technical terms, and specific points mentioned. The goal is a detailed record, not a summary.
2. **Clean Up Audio Artifacts:** Remove filler words (um, uh, like), false starts, and stuttering. Fix grammatical errors to make the text flow smoothly.
3. **Structure logically:** - Use **Headings** (##) to separate distinct topics if the speaker shifts context (e.g., from Work to Personal).
    - Use **Bullet points** for lists or distinct thoughts.
    - Use **Code blocks** for any code, commands, or technical variable names mentioned.
4. **Tone:** Professional, clear, and direct.

Please provide the output in the following format:
